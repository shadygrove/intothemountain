			<h4>Merry Christmas from Into The Mountain!</h4>
			<p>In The Bleak Midwinter is an old spiritual which you have probably heard sung by a large choir.  This year, we have done our own version In The Bleak Midwinter.</p>

			<p>It starts out with a calm riff on electric guitar.  The first couple verses are quiet and calm followed by a nice electric guitar lead.</p>

		<h2>About In The Bleak Midwinter</h2>
			<p>In The Bleak Midwinter is a poem written by Christina Rossetti around 1872.  It was set to the music written by Gustav Holst and became a common Christmas carol.</p>

			<p>The poem itself is very well written and paints a picture of the birth of Christ and how we can respond by humbly submitting our hearts to Him.</p>

			<p>Our favorite verse is the fourth verse which asks "What can I give Him?" and ends with "I can give my heart".  What else do we have but to simply turn over our proud and selfish hearts and submit to our Lord and King?.  We chose to do highlight this by following up the verse with a brief moment of pure silence followed by a powerful and energetic break.</p>

		<h2>In The Bleak Midwinter Lyrics</h2>
		<div class="text-small">
			<p>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,<br />
				earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;<br />
				snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,<br />
				in the bleak midwinter, long ago.</p>
			<p>Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain;<br /> 
				heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign.<br /> 
				In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed;<br />
				the Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</p>
			<p>Angels and archangels may have gathered there,<br />
				cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;<br />
				but his mother only, in her maiden bliss,<br />
				worshiped the beloved with a kiss.</p>
			<p>What can I give him, poor as I am?<br />
				If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;<br /> 
				if I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;<br />
				yet what I can I give him? I give my heart.</p>
			<p><strong>In the bleak midwinter, Christ left His throne,<br />
				Hearts were hard as iron, they were like a stone.<br />
				God had sent His only Son, part of the Father's plan.<br />
				Love had come from Heaven, for the hearts of man.</strong></p>
