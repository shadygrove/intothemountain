			<h4>Merry Christmas from Into The Mountain!</h4>
			<p>In The Bleak Midwinter is an old spiritual which you have probably heard sung by a large choir.  This year, we have done our own version In The Bleak Midwinter.</p>

			<p>It starts out with calm riff on electric guitar.  The first couple verses are quiet and calm followed by a nice electric guitar lead.</p>
			
			<p>Our favorite verse is the fourth verse which asks "What can I give Him?" and ends with "I can give my heart".  What else do we have but to simply turn over our proud and selfish hearts and submit to our Lord and King?.  We chose to do highlight this by following up the verse with a brief moment of pure silence followed by a powerful and energetic break.</p>

			<h3>Coming very soon!</h3>
			<p>We are actively working to provide a download option very very soon. Check back in a bit!</p>
