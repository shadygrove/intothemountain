Then, one of them said, "hey we should record that.", and... so they did.</p>

	<p><strong>Into The Mountain</strong> is not just a band, but a story about friends loving God, loving music and a simply having a great time... together.</p>

	<p>All of us play music in the <a href="http://www.murrysvillechurch.com/" target="_blank">Murrysville Community Church</a> worship team.  We talked often about getting together to play music "for fun", and one day we finally made it happen.  It turned out to be some of the best times of laughter and joy... and we couldn't stop.<p>
