<h2>What Are We About?</h2>

<p>Into The Mountain is about friends loving God, loving music and a simply having a great time... together.</p>

<p>All of us play music in the Murrysville Community Church worship team, and one day decided it would be fun to get together and just play music and have a good time.  It turned out to be some of the best times of laughter and joy... and we couldn't stop.<p>
