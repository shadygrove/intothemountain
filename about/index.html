<h2>Dave Reed</h2>
<p>Lead vocals, guitar, cigar box guitar</p>
<p>Dave's voice brings a sweet and sugary touch of souls blues to our sound.  His guitar licks are pretty tasty as well.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2015, Dave hand-crafted a cigar-box guitar, and we immediately found a place for it on our bluesy version of Pass Me Not.</p>

<h2>Eddie Agate</h2>
<p>Lead vocals, background vocals, guitar, bass</p>
<p>Eddie's smooth vocals can be heard on My Jesus and Pass Me Not.  He also wrote a special chorus for My Jesus, which was a nice addition to the song.</p>

<p>He has played a key role in keeping things rolling.  Without hime, our first couple jams may never have happened.  It was also at Eddie's initial suggestion that we started recording "one or two" songs, just to see how it would go.</p>  

<h2>Scott Lentz</h2>
<p>Mandolin, accordion, banjolin</p>

<p>Scott's melodic mandolin playing can be heard on songs like Come Thou Fount and Grace Greater Than Our Sin.</p>

<p>Simply put, Scott loves music, and has a deep appreciation for the deep roots of music. We consider him our own music historian.  He has kept us all listening to a variety of musical styles and exploring new sounds.</p> 

<h2>Eric Bowser</h2>
<p>Percussion (box drum, tambourine, washboard, and anything you can bang on)</p>

<p>We didn't tell you this, but Eric was a heavy metal drummer prior to joining Into The Mountain.  It was a style switch for him, but we sure are glad to have him</p>

<p>Eric can make a groove that will make you move, and he can he do it with just about anything.</p>

<h2>Martin Bour</h2>
<p>Banjo, guitar, and production engineer</p>

<p>Martin played guitar for years, but a couple years ago he bought a Deering Goodtime II banjo, and it turned out to be a nice addition to the band's instrumentation.</p>

<p>He also happens to have a small recording studio, which enables us to do all our recording on our own time, and saves us a lot of money.  It also helps that he has a degree in music production from Middle Tennessee State University, and loves producing albums and doing all the detailed editing and mixing to make sure we have a great sounding album.</p>
